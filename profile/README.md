# Anything 4 COMPSA

Hello ! and welcome to the Queen's Computing Students' Association GitHub !!

This organisation owns repos which will store any information, documentation, 
and data that might be useful to members of the association as well as any 
students at the Queen's School of Computing.

This organisation will also serve as a testbed for new processes within the Association which
will hopefully allow for greater Quality Assurance and consistency; allowing us
to better serve the students in the School of Computing.
